Title: Energy Consumption Details for the Past 33 years in the U.S.A.
In a comprehensive project, I delved into the intricate patterns of energy consumption in the U.S.A. over the past 33 years. This endeavor involved meticulous data
analysis to uncover trends, fluctuations, and potential predictive patterns in energy usage. By leveraging statistical methods and advanced analytical techniques, I aimed
to contribute valuable insights into the dynamics of energy consumption, offering a nuanced understanding of the past trends and potentially informing future
strategies for sustainable energy practices.
